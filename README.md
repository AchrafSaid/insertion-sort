📌 Insertion Sort – Algorithm & Visualization

This project demonstrates how the Insertion Sort algorithm works through a simple and clear visualization.
Insertion Sort is one of the most intuitive sorting algorithms, working similarly to how you sort cards in your hands: by taking each element and inserting it into its correct position among the elements before it.

🔍 How the Algorithm Works

Start from the second element in the array.

Compare it with the elements before it.

Shift elements that are larger to the right.

Insert the current element (key) into the correct position.

Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

This process builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time.

🎨 Visualization

The project includes a step-by-step visual representation of:

Comparisons between elements

Shifting elements

Inserting the key into position

This helps beginners understand how the algorithm behaves during execution.
